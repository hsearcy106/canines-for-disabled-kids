					<h2 class="research-head">Call to Action</h2>
					<div class="image fit">

					</div>
					<p>When designing my Call to Action, I experimented with sections of importance for the labels and what colors who stand out the most. I end up coming to the conclusion that Donate and Learn More were the most importance actions for the viewer to take. Since donations are crucial to the running of Canines for Kids, this button should be easy to find and read on the front page. I also decided on Learn More because many other sub-categories can be placed under this button like more about the process to become a Canine Kid or even volunteering. Originally, I attempted to have a white outlined button with white text to keep the page from getting to messy. After exploring other options I decided to used this yellow color that I am also using throughout my site. This color pops out more on top of the photo on my home page and is also more fitting to the  childlike asthetic that I am going for.</p>

					<h2 class="research-head">Style Tile</h2>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/style-tile.png" alt="cta buttons">
					</div>
					<p>This is the section where I experiment with colors, textures, and typefaces to find what asthetic I want to accomplish in the end. I decided to go with some brighter colors to bring the a more childlike feel. Along with this same idea I decided on the typefaces Poppins, Chronicle, and Sentinel because of the rounded, quirky letters. I gained a lot of helpful insight from creating this style tile that influenced my final mock-up.</p>
