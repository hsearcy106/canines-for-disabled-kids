					<h2>Primary Research</h2>
					<p> While Canines for Disabled Kids is a great cuase, their website needs some work. One thing I noticed is that when you scroll on the homepage there is a odd space between the nav and the info that makes it really hard to read. There is a lot of muted brown and burgandy throughout the website which is not very inviting. Since this is an organiztion for kids it might help to add more vibrant colors.Canines for Kids offers their services in 12 states but, shows this with a boring, small list. I think creating an interactive map or section devoted to the different locations they work at.The very long list that is used as a nav bar (on all the pages except the home page) is not very effective. I found it hard to navigate because of the small text and the odd hierarchy. On a positive note the logo is pretty clean and represents the organization well. Overall, Canines for Kids is full of great information but, needs to be organized into a more inviting and easy navigating website. </p>

							<h2>Secondary Research</h2>

							<p>According to many articles, there are many different ways trained dogs can help the disabled besides emotional support. These dogs can help disabled people with walking, navigating towards or away sounds, pick up objects, prevent falls, and so much more. The not so largely know contributions of these canines is furtherly discussed in this <a href="https://www.abilities.com/community/buzz/66e-service-dog.html" target="_blank">Abilities article.</a> Not only are they helpful in the most unexpected ways but, they are also helpful in many unexpected places. For instance, the ADA allows the use of service dogs at schools if they are not responsible for watching after the dog.</p>

							<p>These kids have a great need for emotional and physical support just to live a normal life like the rest of us. There are many different disabilities that need acounting for that would effect how a service dog is trained. The <a href="https://www.verywellfamily.com/what-are-special-needs-3106002" target="_blank">Very Well Family</a> Very Well Family discusses the amount of different dissabilities there are and how much support these people need.</p>
